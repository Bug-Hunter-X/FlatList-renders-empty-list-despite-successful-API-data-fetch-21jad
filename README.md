# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList in React Native renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data from an API. The issue occurs specifically when the API returns an array of objects with numeric IDs.

## Bug Description

The FlatList component fails to render items when the data source is an array of objects containing numeric IDs fetched from an API.  This behavior is inconsistent and is not consistently reproducible across various devices and emulators.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the application on a device or emulator.
4. Observe that the FlatList remains empty despite the successful API call.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the `keyExtractor` function in the FlatList component correctly handles the numeric IDs by converting them to strings.  See the `DataFetchSolution.js` file for a corrected implementation.

## Technologies Used

* React Native
* JavaScript
* Fetch API

## Note

This bug highlights the importance of proper key management in React Native's FlatList component, especially when dealing with numeric IDs.  Always explicitly convert numeric keys to strings to avoid potential inconsistencies and improve performance.
